### The stages of evolution in modern software service architectures, from oldest to most modern are _____.

 - Microservices, SOA, N-Tier
 - SOA, N-Tier, Microservices
 - SOA, Microservices, N-Tier
 - > N-Tier, SOA, Microservices



### What was a common problem in software development that was often more apparent in monoliths?

 - harsh domain boundaries
 - requirement for distributed transactions
 - separation of concerns
 - > tight coupling



### A pain point of monoliths that impedes speed to market is _____.

 - tight coupling
 - internal contract definitions
 - > long deployment cycles
 - ReSTful endpoint documentation



### The cost associated with remote calls for most operations in microservices architectures is often called the _____.

 - RPC Penalty
 - Remote Call Cost
 - Microservices Tax
 - > Distribution Tax



### Microservices are always designed to be run in a cloud platform even if they aren't deployed to one.

 - > FALSE
 - TRUE



### What is true of Protocol Aware Heterogeneous Interoperability for microservices?

 - There is polyglot development everywhere.
 - Systems call other systems to do work.
 - > All communications within the service boundaries are solved via ReST.
 - All communications use any technology they want.



### Why do microservices tend to be more complex than monoliths?

 - the requirement on CI/CD
 - the requirement of a platform
 - > the number of moving parts
 - the need to move to more servers



### What is the error response code for SOAP webservice calls?

 - > 500
 - 200
 - 400
 - depends on error



### One of the issues with BPEL is that the workings were often _____.

 - based on XSLT
 - > abstracted from the webservices code base
 - not the responsibility of operations
 - not the responsibility of the developers



### To truly be considered a microservice, there is a hard and fast boundary on the size of the artifact.

 - TRUE
 - > FALSE



### The communication dance in microservices is primarily an effect of the ability of a service to _____.

 - be deployed at any time
 - be written in any language
 - > call any other service
 - be deployed in remote datacenters




### Where does the risk of latency in a microservices architecture come from?

 - versioned APIs
 - the global distribution model
 - > the fact that all calls are remote and cascading
 - the use of event based systems



### The ability to globally distribute a microservice comes from the fact that _____.

 - the API proxy layer exists
 - none of these answers
 - > every call is a remote call
 - cloud providers are global



### The ability to scale in a microservices architecture comes from the fact that _____.

 - reSTful calls are always used
 - > artifacts are single purpose and separated
 - CI/CD pipelines allow for scaling
 - there are more CPU and Memory footprints in cloud providers
